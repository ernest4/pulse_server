## Development

On deploy, Kemal will serve front end and back end. When developing it's more convenient to server
front end separately to take advantage of hot reloading.

To serve react front end:

```
yarn start
```

To serve kemal API (NOTE: will need restarts to compile changes...):

```
crystal run src/server.cr
```
